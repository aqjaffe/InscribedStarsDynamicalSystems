# InscribedStarsDynamicalSystems
Some simulations of the dynamical system which arises when inscribing equilateral stars into regular polygons.

This work is for a research project at Summer@ICERM 2017 with Henry Adams, Samir Chowdhury, and Bonginkosi Sibanda.

Special thanks to Bruno Luong for his polygon edge intersection package.
