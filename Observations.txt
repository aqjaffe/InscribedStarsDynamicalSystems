- res should be approximately between 50 and 100
- Sometimes the warnings can be safely ignored (e.g. n=8,k=3 and n=10,k=5)
- n=7,k=3 agrees with our triangle plot from the first week
- n=11,k=5 gives a strange plot... there are local minima which are not
  equal to the global minima, and the graph is not symmetric about its
  center (although this may be a numerical phenomenon)
- n=13,k=5 has a jumping error at approximately t=0.95
- n=10,k=5 and n=15,k=5 agree with our hypotheses about the shape of
  the side length function
- n=17,k=7 gives a really strange plot... is this a numerical error?
- n=21,k=9 the plot looks very simple again
